# Twitter-Analysis
Using Python to analyse twitter feeds and present valuable insights


I used **tweepy** ( a library in python) to extract and analyse 100,000 tweets from twitter regarding the COP26 conference on climate change. This project also includes the use of **pandas** for cleaning and presenting data, **wordcloud** for creating images with words to describe the most occuring words in a combination of tweets. 

This was done to make highlights into what individuals around the globe were most concerened with or what they mostly discussed in relation to climate change and its effects. This project also takes into account that the information provided does not offer all views and conclusions but however, shows a portion of analysis that can be used to deduce certain outcomes.
